Once upon a time, a clever man sold his well to a farmer. The next day, when the farmer went to the well to fetch some water, the man said that he only sold the well and not its water. The farmer did not know what to do, and with a sad heart, he went to Akbarâ€™s court. Birbal was told to take care of the case. The following day, the man who sold the well along with the farmer was called to the court.
