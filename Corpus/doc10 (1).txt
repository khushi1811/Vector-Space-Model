The villagers held a meeting to decide how to solve the king’s mystery. Birbal offered to help, stating that he needs a month’s time. Birbal took a pot and put a small watermelon in it without cutting it from its vines. After a month, the watermelon grew up to the size of the pot. This pot was sent to the King, and he was told that the wit should only be removed without breaking the pot. Akbar knew that this could be no one else but Birbal, and he went to bring Birbal back to his court.
