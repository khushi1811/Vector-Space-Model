Once upon a time, king Akbar got so mad at Birbal that he told Birbal to leave the kingdom and go away. Heartbroken, Birbal left the kingdom and took refuge at a farmerâ€™s house in a nearby village. Birbal spent his days working at the farm. As time passed, King Akbar started missing his favourite courtier. One day, Akbar decided to send across his royal guards to find Birbal. The guards looked for Birbal in all directions, but all their efforts went to waste.
